## Intro
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
chicago <- read.csv("~/chicago.csv")
```

Today we are looking at daily data on weather, air pollution, and "non-accidental death"" in Chicago, US. *Non-accidental* doesn't mean *deliberate*, it means all causes except accidents, and so is mostly heart disease, cancer, or pneumonia.

The data come from the NMMAPS air pollution research project at Johns Hopkins University in the US. First, look at the variables
```{r}
names(chicago)
```

The variables are `date` (date), `time` (counting from 1), `year`, `month`, `doy` (day of year), `dow` (day of week), `death` (number of non-accidental deaths), `cvd` (number of deaths from cardiovascular [heart] causes), `resp` (number of deaths from respiratory causes), `temp` (average of maximum and minimum temperature for the day), `dptp` (dewpoint temperature: the temperature at which the humidity would be 100%), `rhum` (relative humidity, average of max and min) `pm10` (concentration of particulate air pollution), `o3` (concentration of ozone in the air).

Now look at the data
```{r}
head(chicago)
str(chicago)
```

We need to fix the `date` variable
```{r}
chicago$Date <- as.Date(as.character(chicago$date))
str(chicago)
```

First, is the `death` variable reasonable?
```{r}
summary(chicago$death)
```
The typical values are between 100 and 125. The population of the Chicago area used here was 5.1 million, so that's something like `r round(5.1e6/110/365)` years for everyone to die, which is of the right order of magnitude given that we're leaving out some deaths. We can also check the temperatures
```{r}
summary(chicago$temp)
```
The range from -27C to 33C looks a bit implausible for temperature averaged throughout the day, but Chicago is really like that. 
```{r}
summary(chicago$dptp)
```
That can't be right. The obvious possibility is that dewpoint is in strange US degrees rather than ordinary civilised Celsius
```{r}
plot(temp~I((dptp-32)*5/9),data=chicago)
abline(0,1,col="red",lwd=2)
```

That's plausible. Temperature is always above or basically equal to dewpoint, which it should be. Let's fix it.
```{r}
chicago$dptpC <- (chicago$dptp-32)*5/9
```

Now, plot the `deaths` variable against temperature and against time
```{r}
plot(death~temp,data=chicago)
plot(death~Date, data=chicago, type="l")
```

There's an outlier. What should we do with it?

## Tasks

1. Fit a Poisson regression with number of deaths as outcome and with same-day temperature and relative humidity predictors. 
2. Does dewpoint temperature on its own do as well as temperature and humidity?
3. Look at *season* as an additional predictor.
4. How much difference does it make if you use linear regression on log counts instead?
5. For overachievers: look at better ways of drawing scatterplots with large data sets, either using partially transparent colours (eg `#FF000030` is 20% opaque bright red) or using hexagonal binning in the `hexbin` package.
